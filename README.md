# 🔐 Cybersecurity Projects Repository  
Welcome to my cybersecurity projects repository!  

This collection showcases the practical work I completed throughout my cybersecurity studies, with a strong focus on **automation**, **Bash scripting**, and **hands-on security tooling**.  
Each project is built to solve real-world problems, streamline complex tasks, and demonstrate key concepts in areas such as:

- Network scanning & enumeration  
- Memory forensics  
- Password auditing  
- Anonymous network research  
- Active Directory and domain-based assessments  
- Script-based automation for security workflows  

> **Note:** All scripts and tools in this repository were tested strictly in controlled laboratory environments and virtual machines for learning and academic purposes only. They are intended for educational use and legitimate security research — not for unauthorized or unethical activities.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

Throughout my college program, I developed multiple tools that automate different parts of the cybersecurity process.  
These projects highlight:

### **🔧 Automation**
From scanning large networks to analyzing memory dumps, automation is at the core of every project.  
The goal is always the same — reduce manual effort, increase accuracy, and make complex tasks easier for analysts.

### **💻 Bash Scripting**
All tools in this repository are built using Bash scripting.  
Bash allows for fast prototyping, efficient chaining of command-line tools, and seamless integration with Linux-based systems — perfect for cybersecurity workflows.

### **🛠 Practical Security Tools**
Each project incorporates industry-standard tools such as:  
Nmap, Volatility, Masscan, Hashcat, enum4linux, cURL, Tor, SearchSploit, and many more.  
These are wrapped in automation scripts to create complete, end-to-end workflows.
